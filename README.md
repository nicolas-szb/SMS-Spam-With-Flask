# Project SMS Spam Detector with Flask

This project is based on an NLP work with Artificial Neural Networks.
The goal was to develop a predictive model to detect whether a sms is a spam or not.

## Description

For this project I preprocessed the text with the same tokenization method used in [Project - Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/nicolas-szb/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Deep-learning/Real-or-Not%3F-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets).
Once my tokens list was created and my model was trained, I saved them for a future use.

I integrated my tokens list and model in a Flask application for a first deployment. You can download the smsspamdetectorapp folder and run app.py by using you shell or terminal command as following:
> python app.py
